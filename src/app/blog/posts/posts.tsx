            there is something to be said about how good the word <b>gazillion</b> sounds. like that word has no real numeric value, but you know that whoever is saying it (most likely someone under the age of 5) is referring to some number so large they don't know the actual name, but gazillion <i>sounds</i> like it could do the trick.
            <Break/>
            as we grow older and become more educated these words are used less and less because we have more real words to fall back on - after a trillion comes a quadrillion, then a quintillion and so on and so forth - but i think we lose something more than just fun sounds when we stop using words like bajillion. some words transcend their definitions in ways that are hard to articulate. they begin to convey ideas that are intangible, and would be otherwise difficult to relay in normal conversation. im going to refer to this as 'implied' meaning, but basically any word that uses context more-so than definition could fall into this category.
            <Break/>
            the thing about these words is they are, in some sense, more natural than normal words. at their core words are used to get an idea from my head into yours. and some ideas, like the idea of an unimaginably large yet still finite (and therefore quantifiable) number require a lot of effort and understanding to pass from me to you. this is where <i>unreal numbers</i> excel. the fact that they have no real definition, no numeric value tied to them, but instead have the implied meaning of an extremely large amount allows us to say "it'll cost you a gazillion dollars" and everyone of any age understands that they simply cannot afford it.
            <Break/>
            on a side note i think we should have a power ranking of these unreal numbers. like i would put money on a bajillion be larger than a germillion, but i do think that a gazillion outclasses the rest by a suitable margin.

            the other day, while driving home from the 9 to 5 i swore i would never have, i exited the freeway and was following one of the enumerable teslas one may find when visiting the bay area. there was nothing in particular about this car that stood out; no quirky or memorable license plate (more to come on this later), no two toned wrap that is more suited for a hot wheels or matchbox car - just a factory spec white model y (though those are my favorite of the tesla models). however the destination of this vehicle has situated this specific interaction at the forefront of my thoughts the past few days, and i figured in an effort to finally put this thought to rest, to see this scenario to the logical conclusion, i should sit down and start a blog specifically to write this one post.
            <Break/>
            you see, i followed this tesla for a few blocks until it turned into a church nearby. now there is nothing inherently wrong with this, but something about <i>that</i> car, going to <i>that</i> building just doesn't seem right. it is here that my journey to uncover what is so wrong with this scene begins, and it seems like the only logical place to start is the end. <b>jesus drove an internal combustion engine.</b>

            i can already hear the confusion in the non-existent comment section (which doesn't exist because i will not be bothered to write that and this post) but allow me to elaborate. jesus most certainly drove an internal combustion engine, and i am willing to bet that while there isn't scientific proof for any of this, you know, in you heart of hearts, that there is nothing holy or natural about electric vehicles. man's first discovery was fire and with this power we have risen from the bottom of of the food chain to masters of our domain. there are countless stories across all religions depicting the ascension of mankind and, as you will notice, not a single one mentions electric vehicles. where is the prometheus of electricity? are you really going to claim that ben franklin with his kite and key can hold a candle to the god who bestowed humanity with their most powerful tool and was subsequently forced to suffer for all of eternity? there is nothing in the bible about lithium ion batteries, but i do see quite a few references to horses and their power. the history of humanity has been written in fire, and if we all took a step back to appreciate where we came from it becomes clear why this elemental force is so well equipped to continue propelling us onward, both physically and metaphorically; human history is just as much their's as it is ours.

            moving forward, what is the meaning of life if not finding fulfillment in your everyday life? it is the little things that make you smile which are most important and honestly who here can say that driving an electric vehicle is a 'blast'. and im not talking about those 3 point whatever million dollar hypercars that are also evs (half of those have hydrogen engines in them anyways) i mean real, honest-to-god evs that a regular consumer can get their hands on. i already hear it... i already here some fanboy starting to perspire as they search for the comment section i purposely omitted to type 'duh the tesla plaid zero to sixty faster tha-' no. going fast, fast is only one of the countless things that make driving enjoyable. there are so many intangibles, so much to dissect that cannot be reduced to a statistic that makes 90s station wagons objectively more <i>fun</i> than any ev could ever hope to be. cars are supposed to have character, life is supposed to have meaning, and when we are forced to adopt these sanitized, soulless, unfulfilling methods of transportation we stray further from the path we were intended to walk. to then bring that vehicle to a place of worship feels akin to blasphemy, like sticking your tongue out while grabbing a five off the offering plate.

            look im not going to sit hear and try to convince you of anything. in fact this post wasn't even written for you, i needed to know why driving a tesla to church felt so wrong and now i do - in that aspect this was a great success. im going to bed now, maybe he was just turning around in the parking lot.
