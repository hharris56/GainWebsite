            i've always had an affinity for well designed interfaces, and discovering web design in my mid teens through services like wix and square space presented me with a medium to create some of my own. the tools that initially peaked my interested soon felt too restricting, so after declaring as a computer science major i was disappointed by the lack of web design in my curriculum (zero required courses and only a small handful of electives that were always full). i tried learning html and css on my own, but this proved to be harder than i anticipated and for a while i hated web development, especially frontend, due to early difficulties. however, in recent years the design philosophy started to click and once i became confident in css it felt like a whole new door had opened for creating in the web space.

            that brings us to the this webpage. originally started as a test project on nextjs, ive decided
            to utilize it as a psuedo portfolio for my variety of creative endeavors. hopefully i learn a bit
            about website management, content creation, and curation along the way :)
